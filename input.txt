Flash that buttery gold, jittery zeitgeist
Wither by the watering hole, water patrol
What are we, a heart huckabee, art fuckery suddenly?
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings?
Colorfully vulgar poacher at a mulch like
'I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt.' (Fine)
Sign of the time we elapsed
When a primate climb up the spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog's life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dog fights hog-tied prize sorta costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
It's gore on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cows actually beef
Blood turns wine when I leak for police
Like 'That's not a riot, it's a feast, let's eat.'

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you were judged by the funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky like 'None shall pass.'
None shall pass, none shall pass

Now if he never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
he wouldn't relate to the rouge vocoder bliss
How he spoke through a no-doz, motor on the fritz
'Cause he wouldn't play roll over, fetch, like a bitch
And express no regrets though he isn't worth the homeowners piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz (Fine)

Sign of the swine and the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure and a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like wait, let it snake up outta the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho. ready? go.
Sat where the old cardboard city folks
Swap tails with heads like every other penny throw

Okay, woke to a grocery list
Goes like this: duty and death
Anyone object, come stand in the way
You can be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strap where the backstab lands if it can. (Fine)
Sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
What a bit of gusto he muster up
Make a dark horse rush like enough's enough
It must'a struck a nerve so they huff and puff
Till all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wing span
Even when the cubicle shrink
You gotta pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
NY chew through the machine
None Shall Pass
None Shall Pass

we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies, we don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee, no, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies we just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

and the last shall be, first to immerse in the pass out heat, face in the mud where the moxie melt 'til he woke up drowning in tsatke hell, more in a cave with a torch on the wall than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls on a brand new day, saw what he saw, property owners who crawl to the mall, with a bad toupee and a face like he author the law, pace like he mourning a loss, right hand on a can of worms, left full of gold he will trade for turf, i mean thats o.k., you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day, but a model of mercy and might? no way, marionette who will clap and obey, dude, look, all that noise? call that flight of the water boys, meet and greet and they all slap five, cheek to cheek when they colonize, and a grown ass man shall abide as he wish, walk that path with a dime and a stick, walk that path with a diamond and wine, walk that path to the firing line, just walk, pay no mind to the new recruit with the play-doh spine, let's be friends from opposite ends, wave to the kid don't hop on the fence, play to the radius far and away, orbit wide don't park in his space, one little martyr who talk in his face make one little weathermen sharpen the blades.

and the last shall be, first to the curb with the mad cow meat, face in the bars of a regular cell when he woke up high in collectible hell, boom town kid who was taught by the binge that a man who expire with the most shit win, that's warpy american nonsense penned by the rich, not a routine friend in a pinch, still not used to the stench, how it throws off otherwise lucid events, in the case the afraid observe i got a pro-keds box full of layman's terms, it goes hey, peace, pray for the plagued, major relief and capacious rains, but just cuz i don't want to war with you, it don't mean go warm up the barbecue, i'm like pardon you, sawed off limit, my high noon is a quick little minute, i don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic, who simply isn't going to ever really get it, this HQ is alive and alone, no driveway no sign of a home, no dial tone, no line for the phone, no world's tiniest violin song, and i might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue with a deep breath hiding and bored, fighting a smile, highly annoyed, when the timing is right i will rise and record, cal for the monster beats and blockhead got animal drums like he's doctor teeth, it goes red light green light 1 2 3, one large coffee, fuck you, peace.

Za za zaaa....(chill wit that ill behavior)
Pull the pin out
Sheep creep'in wolf gaurd
Fronted by the hail mary parry lunge mix
Kill the populace for civility
Jepeordy a stickler
His bob and weave amalgam played fountain to your fixture
I'm brain child arms flailing backwards
Wailing for the tiny sound circut
Slitely bile gershhh-win(??)
With a bitter nails and drum lust
Plus disgusted service
Worked in the shifts opposite to your abestos brain furnace
I be the now observ-atory i hear intend-a feeler
Spit'in like a dragon with a similar demeanor
Split innocent bi-stand witness the die hard fans turn rip van in the poppy feilds and ny's talkin traded brick gauntlets
Now i'm think'in who am i
Jabba walky supa fly
Bent left push'in more with out ten step coushin and what
I plan to hope just be positive sacred in these golden viens till i die from grimace over-load
Its shock(its shock)
Treatment offered by the week-end
This opiate get away lets just play the sequence
It goes 1 for the heartless
3 for returning my gardian angel harp-less
And the rest is sweep the mess under the carpet
I drag a yellow taxi meter behind every measurement charge cats labeling me shepard
That'll be 6.50 plus tip doll
An i take cash credit check money-order gold and ciggerette cartons
Got caught up in the universe try'in to zoom in on stardom
Forgot the passion passion plus the hatred ,both were base carbon
Next time you wanna be a hero, try save'in something other then hip-hop
And maybe hip-hop will save you from the pitstop
Kill'em all yeild
Aah man it wasn't me it was hold'in copians brother
I just let him pull the trigger (ohh m)
Well leave me to tip toe past the pearly gates
Capture the halo jet back to base
Step fast to chase the bad taste of jet lag and waste slackers
There ain't noth'in broken
Where you at
Piston pump perfect
Where you at
Base tone is merlin
The services is a urgent work'in surgeon purge'in formulas look'in for an improper cause is whack
What are you saving
Honestly (honestly) honestly
What are you saving
Honestly (honestly) honestly
What are you saving
Honestly
Promise we won't shut the fuck up till recognize what you holden ain't really broken
I don't flick needles like my sick friend
I don't march like beatle baily to a quick trend
I don't freek(?) with churches steeples on the weekend
And i don't comment if you from your little weak zen

All I ever really wanted was a get away
I'ma take a chance by letting a brook slide
Over to my hands
(?)i can not agree to greet fallow
Aleast a borderline war with out reason for the pregame score(?)
Bring out your dead we'll put'em in a pile
And burn'em with the novels so the kids will admire
Kill the ones that speak with a different light
But what brother kill the noise get subject...(?)
Okay
Welcome to the kamakzi bottle rocket cockpit
Live by the icy cold hand of bad intention youth blender
Ok i'll let god warm the bench for now but ascend to spin y'all dizzy
And for the record i'm bring'in my tv with me
It goes let the commoners speak publicly
Then disperse hygene
These cat thats swear by third pupil
But can't see past the loophole
Motherfucker my word is born like siamese triplets
With doctor lawyer rocket scientist promts
Let him grow liesurely
Hey mom i'ma fix whatever i've broken along this path
Once my shpeel's perfected i'm gonna save you a seat in the front row
Of aesop rocks 12 steps shut the fuck up seminar
And when all is bicker and crowds turn swallow
You gone be proud
I tack hacks to the lack board
Honestys a latch cord
Juries fall flop oboslete
Serenity's a crack whore
War character sure a mayhem standard branded by the labor
With a thousand reasons to end this corrupted wannabe saviors
Saw the brightest burst ironically wandering the vacant stage
Gave him the pound for burn'in were bums ratios and gays
Keep me posted as to when you drop something mature sit and sulk about mister
And i'll consider pick'in up your record

What are you saving
Honestly (honestly) honestly
What are you saving
Honestly (honestly) honestly
What are you saving
Honestly
Promise we won't shut the fuck up till recognize what you holden ain't really broken...

I spit wAnnotateith an immense amount of power
Sparks flame showers, cowards, cower, underneath our
Storm clouds that indicate the acid rain hours
Now or, never, ever, ending on a bad note
Ripping a crab's throat, for spitting a bad quote
(Blueprint what's your approach?)
I smash black folk and white folk alike for jokes with mics
And make a Kodak moment out of the most boring open mic
I'll make a sad fan appreciate rap again
Fuck around and forget just how whack it's been
I'm a bad man (Why's that?)
I catch bullets in my molars, body slam boas
And take flight with the weight of the world on my shoulders
And blame David Blaine on any chains that hold us
What started out as food for thought, turned into thoughts to
Turn their crews into food in hopes to satisfy my
Insatiable appetite to dine on lifeforms
Small planets and satellites
You solar system is my condiment;
I vomit comets, and don't sweat the small things and nonsense
Every dog has his day and even more so in rhyming
So I decided that I'd never play the fire hydrant
Or grab the mic sounding lazy, worn down and tired;
Cats don't really fall off they just get uninspired
But before you, get a reason to ever diss us
I'll drop an ill LP and disappear like Bobby Fischer
But this is, the building block of all that is
And what it is, is Alchemy
Alchemy, basic with a touch of wild wonder
Alchemy, we made this to take your style under
Metal frame, walking through a metal game with a limp, tight grip
Determined not to let time slip
This is Alchemy, iron b-boy and all his glory
Alchemy, hold it from the colder sob story
Metal frame, walking through a metal game with a limp; tight grip
Determined not to let time slip
(Ah) Dirty, dirty destiny;
Dirty murders with a burnt version of peasantry
Nervous flux flirtin' with hurly burly chemistry
Graffiti burner urchin merchant with a certain urge to jerk and serve your centerpiece
My zig-zag bully balance gallops with a fiery outline
Ban and bomb y'all pastel poets belly up (I'll tell you what)
One style in 4 dimensions count 'em:
Three to take 'em to ya muck, one to build a world you'll never touch
And I'm a pilot, delirium, serum, poison arrangement
Come browse through an idyllic storm and suck the raw enslavement
With a grin-style stinger creeping out the basement
Encased in wild ritualistic visions of sacrificial bitch cadence
For all my iron giant soldiers with a metal fist up, shielding mother nature
From a fatal wrist cut, story: I respect you
(So why they blaming you for the cats that sleep while the earth turns?)
Yeah I had em' up all night praying I'd re-release Music For Earthworms
Greed eve and I lean, squeamish grip milestone like ring ring ring I just
Caught the screen Phoenix click dial tone
Welcome to a cloud twelve brutal hallucination war pillar
Carnivore, carnival, karma slasher
I dash like a jack rabbit that orbits revelation with a single pounce
To Edward Scissorhands your string of doubts (Yo turn it out)
This is that Mighty Casey homefield advantage to bend your blizzard
With a crocodile smile and five robot knuckles to your kisser
This is
Alchemy, basic with a touch of wild wonder
Alchemy, we made this to take your style under
Metal frame, walking through a metal game with a limp, tight grip
Determined not to let time slip
This is Alchemy, iron b-boy and all his glory
Alchemy, hold it from the colder sob story
Metal frame, walking through a metal game with a limp; tight grip
Determined not to let time slip

I could make 'em all dance, or I could sleep
I could walk with a limp and make your step feel incomplete
people are made of match sticks, light this bread a flames
note at the craft work door the last smirk of the the Damien mainframe
my box cost siphon third rail juice from lost poets
inhabit ocean bottoms with a bitter rotten scapegoat pardons (note to self)
don't bargain at martyr parliament rallies
where participants squeeze your last giggle then whittle sacrificial finalies
I can tie my new faces alone, save your knee deep offerings
sorta bring puke coughing bunk persona to light (I might)
build [?] railroads, find you, and lay tracks adjacent
just to scream "fuck off" as the engine pulls out the station
what should we do with a thousand drunken sailors?
"kill 'em all, locate their family address, release a mailer"

(dear sir or madam, your son or daughter's embarrassed human kind
consuming booze and gut fuel, till they cruised across the line)

I spin gold, your raps are dirty lapsed
towards the nursery class act impression of a bubble
(yeah I could of been more subtle when polluting paradise gene puddle)
man huddles make us look like cool peeps and I'm trying to school sheep
towards the right idea {c'ya - }
this basic divine subsidiary bust center syllable logic, fold origami
plantation shut this picket fence
hang on to your dreams kitten, you'll probably never hear this song
let alone sip the mission long enough to listen

(I smoke cigarettes down to filter, smoke the filter down to space
now I'm gonna roll this question tight and smoke that shit up in your face
now if you were to alter masks every time fame circus approaches
do you really think your maker wouldn't notice?)

Okay, I've died a thousand, and I'll die a thousand more,
I leave footprints in fours, two for bi [?], two operate [?]
practically caress the utterings of crushed [?] brothers and sisters
mothering stickler cabin and madden shit
I'll fix the wing for a penny and a parabole, yeah but this friendship
sunk with a barrel full of [?] pull
I seen guys harbor bad shiners
then wonder why the culprits sitting at the their rainbows ending
want's garbage bag liners [?]
with out the apple seed it's useless (I sat for greed)
patched for boredom crafts a castle out of toothpicks (I sat to breath)
I breath to hard nearly metamorph castle loose pins
now I stand to breath as not to disturb the [?]
and I know that's not a story, it no longer turns my stomach
hollering wolves in the form of one frustrated culprit
but a love tap full of washed up stardom melted trying to milk it
win a ticket to right white lines highway sideways [?]
one love to the rungs in my ladder, one love to the gathering of
laughter bats that hung from my rafters
see the jackal met the badger, they were both such fucking bad asses
that clashing wouldn't make sense (hence my tape deck)
now I ain't gonna name name's, and I ain't gonna drag others in
but I ain't about to say that I'm the only cat you got bubbling
your lucky, somehow you managed to befriend some good people
who will sit and soak the evils you secrete, but why? I'm not really sure

(knock the fuck off, kicking his lip across the floor
'til the archival vinyl venom soak the [?]
anti-clarity mechanism spit flattery burners
fusing a million majesty murders then stole the crown)

oh wait that's right, you discovered me right?
offered up the peace pipe, and oh
It's all cotton candy when Aesop Rock the B light
he's actin foolish left in the middle of laying bricks
(oh we weren't building nothing but a great wall around these stones and sticks)
oh and for the record I've been rhyming since me and Andre thought we could freestyle
built foundation out of passion and brother dusty [?]
studied dope rappers, vocab expansion, poems and syllable placement
your just mad cuz somewhere in there you came and went (I ain't the type to dwell)
dismissed it as casually non compatible and bounced
obtained status where I could straight objectively critique your after projects like
(damn that sounds fresh) or (damn that shit is garbage, what happened? I'm not even laughing)
yeah, but the barriers were broken (you choked)
you made comments to the wrong [?] who out of respect and honor leaked your program
now like were both trying to sit and breath another dawn so my advice
to you is when I say just "move on" (move on )

Raw, I'mma give it to ya, no trivia
Raw like that Aesop rock iron-fisted bliss militia
A bent funny bone, drone community
Spit a thousand and one ripples to cripple the continuity
Tapwater builds character. Right
I irrigate it straight to mainline
You want to do the same? Fine
These pretty profit grommet teams solidify to clot the slippery city sump piston pump drain
Behold "Old King Credible". Kind soul with a Russian-roulette bad mood spin-off
Where every day, a thousand strangers pray for empty chambers
One sixth buckle
Five sixths sweat bullets trying to keep it subtle
But I'll get you (I'mma get at you)
My novelty, wobbly rope bridge broke inches prior to dry land
But duck skull stepping-stones suit the mix down well
Well, when the rumor spreads that y'all stupid
I'll be the cat with guilty look on face and shirt that reads, "I didn't do it"
God, is it on? Is it beyond basic?
Does it ice-grill you? Or is every song faceless?
Does it have a title? If it didn't would you name it?
Does it babble about nothing like a drunk atheist?
We could run that Orwell's '84 warp for the Room 101 detour
Until each client fidgets with his or her own worst fear specifics
Swerve around the cobra kisses
See if the venom overloads this vision, I'mma suck the poison out and spit it
Stole my sneakers but your feet just never fit in
Serves you right for trying to walk a mile outside your limits
I'mma tiptoe across this yo-yo string
Until you walk the dog out from under my feet and skip town, sit down

It goes boom boom boom Boombox C'mon
I originate with the drums
Earth to A.R. vertical
Burden has increased at an alarming rate
Bliss is down a point, murder up, glee down, and still falling
Still crawling out of bed at 2 on Saturdays came this blind soldier-burning confessional
Ease back, let a heart thump echo normalcy for 10
Let the back burner boiling point descend
I race the derby in the first heat (strike personal)
Strike personal space with a most utterly putrid version of grace
Spit the gimmick, sit and fidget wild
In five you'll be jumping through hoops like Coney Island freak show midgets
Want to be a fighter pilot?
Driving that childish early Wright Brothers experiment prototypic model fossil
Sitting sweating bullets on a console
Busting accidental dirt bike donuts outside the most ridiculous poison tongue brain silo
Dead before the chubby debutante conquered the high note
Schooled by the cruel intention invention's pensive sideshow
See contrary to popular certainty, I alone advance
Without an earthly poem, and dance on a handful of zoning fans
Combing every chance to own the land, I roam with dome in hand
And truly be its only camper happy with the scrap heap
See I convince myself it's on, therefore it is
And the melody settles beneath the fact that I'm just spitting for these kids
I tried to get 'em all open, and once I quit and said I didn't care
That's when they all threw their hands in the air

I've been a biplane dog fighter Henson invention
Trooper burst result of Dragon Ball Z/Speed Racer gene splicing
Mach force, blind the extorted style from the common dirty
Destiny dream sighting, important as split the prints
God shit the planet screaming "What on Earth is that?"
I sit back five dimensions
Only to muscle the overcooked specimen
Fending tragic fatality successful dodging violets
All hail Mary and hello dollies!
I flow ridiculous, indigenous to now
Who holds the fifth golden ticket?
Saw the wicked war phantom mansion beyond the pickets
The house next door to when the stickball clears the fence
Y'all hesitate to fetch it!
I was walking through a pinball tilt built landscape
Terradactle circling turtle
I bite the bullet in a wingspan shadow
Suck and rust the oxygen gulps
And spit the metal directly back up the barrel
We icegrill the silhouettes (right)
The common decency factors a lowball estimate of zero
My testament is striking b-boy stances
Dancing past the foggy mirror
With wipes clean the billy goat beard, camoflague the spirit
I'm at six degrees of sexy sarcasm
Yeah never swam up inside summerjam classic
Under the bed backwards bastard
Scaverning the carnival grounds for an outlet
WHO THE FUCK IS AES ROCK?
I'm not a name to keep at arms length
Adjacent to little ? quilt makeshift
Sick security mechanism, check your mission
I am not a vision, check your mission
Just a simple sourpatch delinquent
No it will not help you shove your Lincoln

I alone settle
I alone peddle in the mud
I alone, I condone rebel zone planting
I alone stand in a social coma
All up to your dome, follow I alone
"Now you see me, now you don't" 
Well he was maverick enough but still scraped up
Taki 183 innovation for the kids
Brick foot ironlung honor
Escape through the night like a disgruntled teen Krylon bomber
Without a care inside from posting the roster
Mal-adjusted blank faced civilian dispersed feelings
Reeling in several separate defunct fame-booster modules
This nervous twitch mark the most delectable ingredient
See Aesop starving troops in cell blocks with strap-on feeding bins
(More like) Like I'd auction off a fuck for that blind cause you ride in
I'd rather find the floors and watch you hide them
Feel the haggered look penetrate brain castle
Blasting clear out the back of this batches sour wind collection
(FLASH FLOODER!)
You're a fuckin wind-up toy
A goddamn four string criminal trading card
The reason they decorate the fonts of closing credits
To boost on-looker amusement after fading hard
Catch more Z's than Rip Van Winkle's 12 Step Narcolepsy Seminar
The action, we all compete the masked illusion
The commonfolk, I provoke em all
Challenge thirty balance
I alone pour talent while they fidget
If the revolution ain't gon' be televised
Then fuck, I'll probably miss it

Used to draw
Hard to admit that I "used" to draw
Portraiture in a human form
Doodle of a two headed unicorn (it was soothing)
Moving his arm in a fusion of man made tools
And a muse from beyond
Even if it went beautifully wrong
It was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong
No name nuisance
Fools in a bedroom
Oozed in a brand new cuneiform
Barely commune with the horde
Got a whole grey scale ungluing his world
Might zone out to the yap of the magpie
Unseen hand dragging his graphite
Cross contour little bit of back light
Black ink after a Bristol to baptize
You can imagine a rush that ensue
When you get three dimensions stuffed into two
Then its off to a school where its all that he do
Being trained and observed by a capable few
Back in New York five peeps and a dog
In a two bedroom doing menial jobs
Plus rhyming and stealing and being a clod
Distractions free to maraud
I left some years a deer in the light
I left some will to spirit away
I let my fears materialize
I let my skills deteriorate
Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing
A mission that was rooted in a twenty year affinity and rickety condition with an
ID crisis

Nap on the front lawn look up in the sky its.
Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart tho he woulda made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
And there were
Colors pouring out of the fringe

All heart tho he woulda made cowardly kings

They will chop you down just to count your rings

Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
Used to paint
Hard to admit that I "used" to paint
Natural light on a human face
Stenciled fire on his roommates bass
It was blooming addiction
A miss and a push and a pigment
Book like a tattooed pigskin (look)
Pin head kids Intermittent
Drank kool aid from a tube of acrylic
And i grew up in a linseed oil over linen
Joy to the poison voice in the resin
Capture a map of the gesture
Back up add a little accurate fat to the figure
Re do that move that inwards
Zinc white lightning shoots from his fingers
Studios drone with allusions of tinctures
Stay tuned for the spooky adventures
You can imagine the stars that align
When a forearm starts foreshortening right
Or a torso hung on a warping spine
Of proportion reads as warm and alive
Routine day with a dirt cheap brush
Then a week goes by and it goes untouched
Then two then three then a month
Then the rest of your life you beat yourself up

I left some seasons eager to fall
I left some work to bury alive

I let my means of being dissolve

I let my person curl up and die
Eating up his innards an unfeasible anxiety is brutally committed to relinquishing

his privacy aligning with the trials of the anti Midas

Nap on the back lawn look up at the sky its...
Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart tho he woulda made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings

And there were
Colors pouring out of the fringe
All heart tho he woulda made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
I'm getting sick and tired of never understanding... Where is the truth you promised?!


Question: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage
Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face?
I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain
I'm tryin' to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste
The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch
Steep in a self imposed Stockholm and Lima in flux
Maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks
Made any mingling akin to being seasoned and stuffed
It's a theatre of jumpin' jellyfish, jealous little sycophants
Miserable and flimsy from the skippies to the pissy pants
Each one seperately convinced
They're sketching with Da Vinci's hands
Delusion turned the communication to prison camp
You fuckin' dorks ain't a threat to the cause
There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost
I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts
Step out the tempest
A measure of what the spectrum involves

Maybe no one cares, party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene
It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe
Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive
I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe
I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong
The songs are echolocation up in impregnable fog
That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws
Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs
In a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry
I ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling
God almighty chop an ivory tower to piano keys
Play your own dirge on the way to surfin' maggot beach
You fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art
You can't be cooler than the corner
Where you source all your parts
The poker-faced, all it takes a couple sordid remarks
We let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark

Life is so unfair, party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I view the rattling of sabres like a show to expose
Insecurities exploding in emotional code
With braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross
Corrode a homie til his probity is notably ghost
Before the hobby was a jobby was a miniature Hell
You would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle
The disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill
But you as anything menacing is a difficult sell
In a whistle-and-bellorama, black mollies that dress up like piranha
It's not even compelling melodrama
It's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga
I'm very voluntarily persona non grata
You fuckin' dorks ain't the leaders we need
This ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed
I'm often coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen
Don't make him show the regency what disobedient means

Heavy load to bear, party over here, I'll be over there
Don't need no help, all by myself


My spirit animal comes with a pretzel bun
Troll of the treadmill
Record on the Kessel Run (allegedly)
Edgy from elevenses to megabucks
Techies with the treble down
This is how we level up
Dead meat, time travel, pressure, and disease
As ushered out of two fingers pecking at the keys
The coping mechanism in his LMNOPs
Went from healthy to unhealthy to a hell he never leaves
Cineplex jesus, curse at the curly fries
Mullin' over Chuck D telling me, "Diversify"
I'm at the SuperCuts supin' up the wardrobe
Forecast looking like Ganesh on four phones
"Hello, hello, hello, hello"
Base camp, space camp
Bass in your face-fuck, brace for the rain dance
Back in the back of the classroom
After a magical nap in a vacuum

Act natural, whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
(Superfresh)

Before climbing douchebag mountain, I was skate or die
Started eatin' kale and came to terms with my lazy eye
Puttin' on the yoga lady, cuttin' off the cable guy
Whistle while you're waiting for your condition to stabilize
AV cables everywhere, every piece of vinyl scratched
Mentholated tiger balm, Aleve with the arthritis cap
Irons in the niacin, iron Quiet Riot masked
Unabashed privacy expanding into simulcast
40 winks, never the same adventure
Refreshing, or the single longest exorcism ever
In the end, you gotta wonder if it's even worth the effort
No stairways into heaven, you can step into the Escher
Some people have mistaken my allegiance for a weakness
It fucked me up for eons, I wished I was a theist
The type that fake his death then forget he faked his death
Show up on TV, in the crowd at the AVNs, like...


(Hey peace Aesop uh It's Chuck D
Yo man, you keep doin' what you're doin' man
Keep rhymin' through those walls, alright?)

Sometimes I feel my heart putrefying inside my body
From diary of dark to piety in the ponzi
On my better days and then mingle and walk off into the poppy
On my worst, the work is overshadowed by the monty
Had to buy some clothes that fit me
And pretend I like agave
With a promise to his congress not to compromise the motley in him
Maybe I should kinda sorta move to Mars
I'm feeling kinda done, too many moving parts
The piss poor vision is forty percent floaters
The kitchen is a chorus of glorious leftovers
The friends you confessed all the dark shit to
Would weaponize the information before we could send roses
And they want a little pearl in how he got to where we at
I can't remember where I am, I feel it's probably a trap
Balk with the lawless, cough in his notes
Walk on even when the walls hug his coat

Oh and act natural, whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
Whatever that means for you
(Superfresh)

The non bon-voyage stock weaponry and soylents
And whatever stopped the voices
Colossal paranoia's out to author an abrasive lore
About how warpaint won't assure you ain't a painted whore, baby
No ground wires, all jaw froth
Mouth breathing outliers climb outta mothballs
Wrung stones unsung and alone
Known to run up in the unknown "Honey I'm home!"
I push a bucket of bolts, a sort of death in his wake
I take the hand off the thief, I take the head off a snake
Approach a pen like revolution's just a sentence away
Til then he's documenting cops and watching heaven decay
It's not a gentleman's game it's a generation braced accordingly
Who know the differences between the cozy and the quarantine
Yes y'all the crest fallen care warn
Air horn, air horn, air horn, air horn

These awful winds
Those grinding gears
This pile o' bones
That's why I'm here
Wild frontier
(Come on)

These violent drums
Those primal fears
This pool of mud
That's why I'm here
W-w-w-w-wild frontier

That's impossible, body's still warm
Scavengers already obsessively knocking on his molecules
I'm catatonic, fat, and outta rocket fuel and ramen
Not a dollar, watching Rocky II in Donatello boxers
At some hot as hell motel in what's supposed to be his Shangri-La
More akin of angry mobs with anchor tats and mangy dogs in vacant lots
Traded any semblance of consistency to play the odds
Not even a baby doll to change his gauze
Not even a hide-away to hide up in
A side effect of sliding environment to environment
Driving isn't simply when the tires spin, try again
Departures and arrivals aren't only time in mileage
Try again again a raider break off from the phalanx
And never look back never cook crack K thanks bye
New York in the rear view then peel...
Out, til he found New York in the windshield

[Hook 2]
These cursed dogs
Those flying spears
This rancid food
That's why I'm here
Wild frontier
(Come on)

These fleeting hopes
Those vital prayers
This bag of cash
That's why I'm here
W-w-w-w-wild frontier

This was never an effective way to rally insurgents
Or really even the occupation of a rational person
When you write about seclusion and some buyers finally tune in
You get frightened finding happiness can drive away the movement
In a jiffy, just eat your food and keep the future iffy
That fruition's for the viewers who need a loser to pity
Plus an underlying message of a greater disconnection
God forbid he try to live or gain momentum
Mend or pay his penance
You'd rather see him eat a bowl of mouse traps
Surf a thousand couches
Take a jagged little down the hatch
Chowder heads
I know you love the way the failure flounder
Maybe I could be your daily downer
If his brain left his body and was headed for the door
Would you take it in and help it find its way into a jar?
No? fuck it, let him hop around a maze
We can see who's really lost when the schadenfreude fades

These churning seas
Those quiet sneers
This box of parts
That's why I'm here
Wild frontier
(Come on)

These creepy friends
Those dicey dares
This perfect dark
That's why I'm here
W-w-w-w wild frontier

Look
Unsigned hype
Front line aeronauts flurry
Zero dark thirty
Zero friends minotaur-fugly stepchild
Evoke lunch jumped over plunging necklines
Up, beside tongue-tied hungry enzymes
Devote one into mothmen munching textiles
Punisher
Out past go-time
Back 10 fried worms chubbier
Brown grass both sides
Canned food
Manmade tools
Lanacane, band aids, mandrake root
Bindle on a broomstick, pancaked shoes
And a handshake-proof campaign, can’t lose
Can’t gain
Smoke out moles like a force of nature
Pray fortune return to his favor
Swiftly
Maybe in the form of a nest egg
Maybe in the form of a tesla death ray
Or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate
Than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day
M-m-moral compass all batshit
Spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets
Are we supporting the artist or enabling the addict
I mean, I guess it matters to me
I wish it mattered to you
How a thousand virtues
Kick the same bucket like chinatown turtles

Roving packs of elusive young become
Choke-lore writers over boosted drums
In the terrifying face of a future tongue
Down down from a huntable surplus to one
Down down from a huntable surplus to one
Down down from a huntable surplus to one
Down down from a huntable surplus to one

Check his own Breakneck pulse
Over colors in a drain
That emote sugar skulls in the rain
Flower-eyes melting
guided by a levy made of bath tiles tilting
Quarter up and headed for the kill screen
No corner cut, no build team
Only a particularly menacing
Angle perpendicular to everything
Boys room cherry bomb
Boy/goon very much runnin' with the devil in the mellotron
Hello
Here’s where a tale of caution
Pounds coffin nails
To bootlegs of Hawkwind, saw tooth
Nevermind straw to gold
Spin hearts on sleeves into heads on poles
Arm in the maw
Fish out pith like a business card from a jar at the mall
A-alike androids dreaming of carbon applause
Get stuffed with cartoon cigars
Cold pack, neti-pot, home to roost
Around folk backed into what they most lampoon
Shook to the fevered brow and broke ankles
Daisy, declawed pound, no thank you
Fade me
Failed all basic training
But I spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling
Silhouette the god’s last cigarette
Anything less would be ri-god-damn-diculous

Roving packs of elusive young become
Choke lore writers over boosted drums
In the terrifying face of a future tongue
Down down from a huntable surplus to one
Down down from a huntable surplus to one
Down down from a huntable surplus to one

(MF Doom)
€I can stop any time I want to.
Famous last words that came back to haunt you
All your life, like permanent dried tears.
Some cats get it like no bright ideas.
He broke the record then bowed.
Said he couldn't do it without the crowd, for crying out loud.
Even took the time to contaminate the rhyme scene
And drop a lot before he was out, in the common scene.
A lot of rappers are drama queens (buddy dutty ?)
When they come to the mic, I'm €˜a feel ya's. (buddy buddy ?)
Fuck around and get your title took, cut and dry.
He doesn't lie, even like â€œwho and where, what and why?â€
Hold it like a cue â€˜n button, button fly (boom boom) (?)
Once they leave the room, they be like, â€œDoom! Doom! Doom!â€
It's no use. Blessed to design
And the villain has left the building, dressed to the nines.
Like, I'm â€˜a do mine. Ya'll do yours.
He stay reppin' the game like Lou Rawls
The super MF villain, feelin' like two balls,
For the microphone, he joins like two falls. (?)
Well we'll see after these criminals who falls.
A lot of ya'll is reminiscent of Rupaul.
Ball to ball and we'll be needing new drawers.
Drawers, the one-twos that run through walls.

All in it together now.
Some of the misadventures of a father crop
My provider chop's flashin'
See, I'm â€˜a stop that gut reaction
Bound to tackles when a battle runs in circles
Like rodeo clowns with paddles.
Poked in the belly by petty sarcasm.
Gentlemen, start your laugh tracks.
Push pins for the lab rat breed.
All I wanna be is a fat cat sleeping 40 nights (nights)
In hopes that when I rise,
The hacker mass will have seen there's more to life.
Let's recreate a perfect service rooted in labor lust
And a discipline prisoner.
I don't work a thick antithesis.
Parallel park your burning prod adjacent
To the flagrant iron ego valve
Let us study a weaker outlet
I found peace (I found peace)
I found peace, it tap me on the shoulder
Asking where's the closest war and how to make it sleep
I pointed toward the exact place my sneakers met the creedence,
Said â€œIf I could answer questions (who), I would be relief.â€
Now classify don't got â€˜em shook by exposing the skeletons
Yeah I sorta stick to a more murky-hurt development.
Some of these kids are spittin just a bit too delicate a thesis.
If onlyâ€¦ Yeah, but holy jumpin Jesus!
I get torn swiftly from a planet while it tilts, 23.
Look buddy, we've gotta talk.
God made me a fine instrument of style
Zig zag zisfiss?
Don't make me holy sleep bolts blindly until your mood shifts.
Now here comes 40 acres of congruency pistons,
Purple skeleton key immunity systems.
Aw, it'll be something incredible.
See, I know the limit.
That's why I do my best to stay quiet
Whenever I ain't spittin the gimmick.

Jiggy-jabberjaw vitamin idol and primal rages
When bible page verse tidal waves begun (Water one)
I wrote the book that shook America to splinters
In a winter wasteland Icicle-bound barren township
Call Baron Munchausen's proud gimps to clinch this chemical war pig
Delinquent sinkin like a paper tugboat
Well beneath your holiday
Beached on a red tide infested shore corroding eastern seaboard beauty
I'm a jigsaw slab, but all the pig saw was dirt bag

It's like a bleeding comet bombing on your sequels
To the riverside park tunnel people claim last lifeform standing
Carbon based pardons ain't enough
My stilts truly personify the serbonite flea circus
We urchins merkin on daily
I catapult brain opera past basic
Tear my own face off in the finale, stick around it's ill
Diabolic Prodigal Son spill grimmace
If you had one more eye, you'd be a Cyclops
Which explains missing the premise
Bliss mimic, baptise, chastise, laugh die
Kiss the finish, piss the villagers the fuck off
Pete Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes
Aes Rock might've smoked one too many dimes in his time
Now where you gonna be when the sun falls, brother
Probably gathering your sheep with all these other mothafuckers
Struck twice in the same place by a moody Zues fishliner
Smackin the third clear out the park
Going gone (To infinity and beyond!)
I rocked for a flock of Chewbacca look-alikes in magic makers
Hermit crabs and New York city sewer aligators
Keep your homily dream out your homily
I deal with tangible goods
And avoid manufacturing food for landfills
I've seen friends bow to needles
I've seen needles bow to records
I've seen boughs break
I've seen God bow and make the clouds shake
I've seen the proud break
I've seen alot for a blind soldier
Who tattooed the city scape up skin to blend in
Rats travel by night invite the waterbugs
I'm here to pull the three-prong
When it's prime directive wormhole of self-sacrifice
Had a hatchet slice for camps
For that God-awful Frankenstein
Starving your style to someday be a story in my kids
Life's hard, life's easy
Life's everyting in between me
Life's Peachy like James and the Giant
And I keep spittin as long as these kittens buy it
And I keep casting my line as long as these fish will bite it
And I like it (Don't try it like that)

"Yes the bough is low
That's the way it goes though...
Maybe I should just give up or just stop trying
But life is so uncertain, so short
I've got to keep on searching
And wherever it takes me, I've got to go"

Ran away temper tantrum, decrepid anthem
Set a low goal, I arrived late
I'm here to scrape a car clean to the funk machine
Imposes on the underling amalgam cluster and identifies the mother
(You got heart)
I hate to tell you but it skips more than it palpitates
Like these here little drunken archers missed one of they calculate
The falcon hates the mockingbird
The farmer hates the drought
I hate em all, I kick the bottom brick out shouting "Yes y'all"
And blow the village out perspective (Aesop!)
Do you take this makeshift-Candy Land-cult classic-bastard style
To be your lawfully wedded head trip
Doing base throughout sickness, health, electrical storm
Fire, pain, rain, hail, wind, ice, sleet, snow? (Hell no!)
I'm balanced, personified phantom to the bone
Walkin like a Jabberwocky
Scalpin a pair of one-way tickets to shadowboxing
Just like christmas with a shallow stocking
Like this (I'm just trying to milk the mileage)
You drop science like Don Herbert with liquor in him
Soundin off like senior citizens sitting at bingo parlor bickering
Yeah it's kinda funny, isn't it
How I can build while you just sit there and bitch about your syllabus

Dwarfed by the lights, bewildered by the fanbase
Bound by an idea, skeptical of the handshakes


(Give him one of these pills if he has any pain)
(A parable.... What is it? Well, it's a little story with a lot of truth in it
An earthly story with a heavenly meaning
Jesus told many parables to grown-ups and children alike
He told them simply and sincerely, in words everyone could understand
So that all might learn the lesson he was trying to teach...)

They were selfish with the helmets on the little bus
'Till brick fluid sewage crippled up the get-retarted nickel punks
Slowly cope but swore his lowly robot foley folk
Would one day rise in sections to interrogate the Holy Ghost
(I knew it!)

Holy smokes!
Father, black suit white collar
Kiddie porn dungeon, guns, and three fingers for your daughters
Caught belly-up, antique Nazi paraphernalia
You can not pay you bills with holy water and Hail Mary luck (Oh my!)
Shucks, fucker, enjoy the Alcatraz shower fun
And mommies mad I'm cliché generation X Agnostic front
It aint the nifty faith of 1958 before the New-New Testament approved altar-boy fistic rape
And "take me to your leader" lung as he dope manipulate toddler beaver (Leave him alone!)
Call me crazy but I'll bet that wasn't God's demeanor

Sodometer peaking (Me too!)
But Long Island was Jesus every weekend spoon-fed to appease traditional upbringing
Of a little Pennsylvania shit-hole where elders movement
Stressed the stellar therapeutic Bible cycle (How?)
One church with a bait and tackle store next door and not much more
So the two moved to New York, made babies raised on what they'd saw
Christmas morning smelled fresher than angel pussy
But immaculate conception came second to playful goodies
Like laser-tag was way more spiritual than blood and body wafer bags
And manger staff as long as Santa ate the cookies (Well...)

Grandma was a saint while he'd paint with snakes and bullies
Said If only you'd memorized your prayers like you did your Kool-G!
By the time I was old enough to know what religion was
I was Catholicism-numb and truly didn't give a FUCK!
94' Moved out the crib and it ain't seen a steeple since
While Knievel-Evil seeps in a Christian leader's pitch.
'Till priest's lap slapped with parental advisory warnings
I'll be auditioning God's in my office on Monday morning

Uh-oh! And yet another pill slipped
down the hatch It patch him through the kill-switch
I need a couple A's for Q's
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused

(This story reminds us of the one Jesus told about people who were kind and helpful to others
He said that one day the king would say to these people
"Come, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
For when I was hungry you gave me food
I was sick and you visited me
I was in prison and you came to me"
But the people asked
"Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you?
Or sick or in prison and come to you?"
And the king answered
"In as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren
You have done it unto me")
(Yeah!)

Just a little bruised in the back of the pews
Acting amused with a mask on them Vatican blues
For in the eyes of the organization I was raised in
Aes is just another sinning brick in Hell's basement
Cubicle adjacent to the killers and rapists
For what? Drugs and fucking is part of growing up
Like cuffs over dumb shits better than the schools
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused

Just a lit fuse in the back of the pews
Watching a thousand flavors of the same God feud
I figure ultimate-peace is the common theme
So its a no-brainer piece when the blood hit the screen
Got a basic good and evil sensibility born
Good neighbor know a halo wouldn't fit over horns
I'm more science than faith, I'm more karma than bread and booze
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused

Two shoes chewed up, colluded with the feuds, rogue, veterans,
Food, clothes, medicine.
Wheeled it out the smoke stack factory trained to capture in the zoo's ghost predators,
Food, clothes, medicine.
I think I thunk a bunk colony could possibly amuse grown delegates,
Food, clothes, medicine.
Peace, the whipper-snapper generation greet 'em with a full blown pistol pull,
Food, clothes, medicinal.
Variety, for every plastic orange bottle,
The tarnished pharmacy labels chafed in abrasive pockets,
Suit the hell hounds with blades and chain lengths
For the dead walk a little less clumsy than you think.
Hunger pain, chump change tell it to how his belly get
When bourgie hopes hellions,
Food, clothes, medicine, alumni,
Bum, I got the skin on the teeth between my fingertips and stellar,
Let's bet it melts together.
Let's get these men some shelter
Three hots and a cot with Quaaludes
On a pillowcase left on an ultimately cordial gesture by the staff,
It's a bath house for brave soldiers
When they coordinate to fornicating whores in maid's clothing.
Sip a hot mocha, kick-up-chug up to the apple box,
Frankie says "relax", 20 says he snaps, SAFE WAGER,
Hell, 90 percent sensitive jubilee,
Never returned to brag about that fish bigger than you and me.
Walk on glass, cruise cloaked residents.
Bang on doors, food, clothes, medicine.
United we stand to all our parties click,
I divide and conquer cuz frankly I'd rather sit.
We saw them rat races, machine or man, sprocket or fat laces,
Hatchback of flashbacks from a heyday full of bad blazers,
Now Major Aes route the following orders
To all his crew's chromed generals,
Food, clothes, medicine.

Walk on glass, bang on doors,
Talk all trash, hang on whores.
Walk all cash, bank on wars,
like food, clothes, medicine, it's yours
it's yours
it's yours
it's yours

We role tape protocol on a ring finger neighbor to peruse gross negligence,
Food, clothes, medicine.
Martyrs leak faster if the carver tweaks the dagger, 90 moves choked citizens,
Food, clothes, medicine.
Well yapple freakin zapple they've sapped this commitment's castle, cool, dope, excellent,
Food, clothes, medicine.
It's tough to legislate when scum tongue down a dinner plate of booze, coke, heroin,
....
I'll bite the hand that feeds,
Chew the steak and spit the knuckles back,
Stitch 'em up and give em dap, before his brother's rubberneck,
Iron chef Lithuania christen kitchen stadium,
With chicken and mass serotonin drifting into gravy-dom,
Save me some, scallywags hold your breath,
The curmudgeon's gun dusty like the road to death.
Bag a pin stripe militia kisser no kill switch,
Just a guilty gizzard wanna recommend a pill slip.
I wipe placenta off my face in the height of the disco era,
Grew through liquid bubble gum, fever, death, and christmas sweaters,
grew through saccharin fast food study hall and cliff's notes benders,
Now holds a bachelors in training ninjas to tip toe better.
These are them sham city kidney kicks to the loose bolts
Belly ache-killins for claim who stand iffy on food, clothes, medicade.
Pollywog, hug a spot lit with bigger lizards
In the land of hot milk and honey with stingers in it. ZINGER.
Jimmy to jist up, check ya tip cup,
Mother's watching babies near to preachers keen on fist fucks,
Keep your schnoz clean, ears open, chopper zipped up.
Food, clothes, medicine, cuz hungry, naked, sick, sucks.
Collide your worker ants, with autobahn inertia dance,
And curb them harp love bugs by the cursed final curtain clamp.
Another savior with his foot, cold, stuck in his mouth,
I played that who knows, food, clothes, fuck it, I'm out.

Walk on glass, bang on doors,
Talk all trash, hang on whores.
Walk all cash, bank on wars,
like food, clothes, medicine, it's yours
it's yours
it's yours
it's yours
Food, Clothes, Medicine.


Take me to the basement
let me count the holes in your foundation
ancient ridicule system alert, kissing my lurk
the perch of rare grimace on iron mask
i remember science class
if chemistry could silence the lions laugh I'd be fine
(i fail tah) molindone up
adrenaline trades the leaves that walk the plank
before the crimson struck a match this season
meridian carpal will jolt your logic
when the burn earned its self normalcy for 20 plus
run amok or sink, swims not an option
she applied the lipstick slow
slow enough for me to bask in
fast enough for me to wish it lasted
past my alarms cackling
the front line of its mystique's geek
doubled my proposals,bargains

well that'll sip the blood of merry men

that's why its discolored,ragged and shitty
i ain't about to toss when its been through all these dream wars with me
ima undercover profit,thrift shop god
i rather starve then sit inside this gridlock till it parts
this tailor made rutiny ain't suitin me
it's tied around my neck like 13 loops rafter an apple box
heartless harvest of mine,I'm tired of pissin benediction
maybe it ain't healthy,but sometimes i rather burn then let you help me
it's getting brisk, brisk as f**k
my skin ain't thick enough ,these icicles ain't civil
how many freezer burn victims can one society on tilt manufacture
prior to hire,being intervening just to release last laughter
and every tree trunks made of third rails with tourniquet branches
and i learned to walk with an anchor in my back pocket
and man i read palms during even the most brief handshakes
and man i ain't alive to pull the weeds around the spotlit
well I'm wallowin, followin my little lost princess to the promise land
hollerin my potent slogan,hell if Nostradamus can

Well, so we meet again
(He said he's grown spiritually since the last one)
Ok, this is the dawning of the book of bitter aspects
Where the jackals sit and watch the pedagogue last flesh
Poison functions accompanied by six armorclad
Black horse and buggy mechanism
Tugged a portion of my severed vision
The gathering of loose ends in a bucket
Wit a shoestring budget
Every man's got a field to plow (I know that now)
But it's like, man I really can't afford the oxen
Fee fie et cetera
I smell the warm blood of the bill collector knockin
I get awkwardly sturdy with a frigid liquid backbone
I get swept in the pressure cooker tryin to paddle back home
I get sprung with a vibe and alliance of clean intention
By eclipsing doom midigons hatched to bash these picket fences
Now I'll attend the wedding of the open sword festering
Now when the groom presents the ring
The bride commence to blistering
This textbook magnificently crude
Prototype king beserker modulate

The first step is a doozy, it’s roulette with a mood ring
The birth of an old slang, the death of a new speak
A permanent post-game, a spitter with bridge trolls
Skirting the copay, divvy the death toll
Maneuverable codenames, alerted and mobile
Familiar rising, and furnacing cold piles
Resilient style kings, impossibly tantrum
Wandering wild things, obelisk phantoms
On linoleum or lava, leaders of a leadfoot fauna
His left source blunt force trauma
Not pillar of the commune, a splinter off the pagan
Who vote off the elusiveness of truth and exultation
From the point of view of students labeled putrid little aphids
By the beautiful and cryogenic stasis
Sadists, meanwhile makers of a hideous whatnot
Committed to a lowdown Sisyphus up-rock
Are shaving at a truck stop, aging exponentially
Homie, no myth flowers grow where he piss
And I still row boats outta bottles without abandon
To shrink into the sunset bumping Pachelbel's Canon
In D motherfucker, the author of the artistry
May or may not be weeping to an automated pharmacy

If you step on the lawn I keep the foot
Peep, in the pot go 6 degrees of cooked geese
Boiling, blitz the beach of mushed peas
Over 10 meat hooks with a blister each
I'm all pincher, fever-y hoodie on, hoodie off
Sweat thru his E.T. sheets to the worry dolls
Never met a quiet storm that didn't grow into a choir of colliding horns that go click click clack
In territorial syntax
Sitting on the porch with his lids pinned back
Pinball wiz in a thimble of sims
I'm a symbol of whimsy abridged
Kiss me I'm dead, nursing a mystery Dayquil
Led Zep staring daggers down page mill
How pray tell do he sit pretty when the ol' 1 2 unglue in a tizzy
Please hold for the don't play dull boy
Click, I am not a page or a pull toy
Came in the door and the floor is lava
Killjoy if your core more Norman Rockwell
Born home sick for an invisible address
Bat shit, bumble and bat around catnip
One black heart Katamari massive
Packed in a fat category 5 rat nest
Nose on his sleeve, holes in his inner peace
Robot phone like a tentacle of flippancy
Hate you, hate you more, no I hate you infinity
And Pangaea break into smithereens
Interlude prest-o change-o
If it move to quick oh whey oh
Right brain go white train Ramo
Mustache any old Money, "no!"
Merrily merrily merrily merrily
In a cobweb tomb on a hotbed of heresy
Frog men schooled by the god Ed Emberly
Pull dog sleds and exhume Dead Kennedys
Bet, moth into kerosene awful
A caution to straw men lost on vaudeville
A-morally mixing business with 144 dixie whistlers
Lawn chair, strong man twisted whiskers
NASCAR Bic in his missing fingers
Outcast from a system of kiss-the-ring-ers
Are you privy to the misadventures
It's electric, meeting in the middle of the street
With a lethally modified piccolo pete
There is admittedly an incredible mystique
To meddling in the reason a city won't sleep
48 strings of 12
That ring ring ring, whiz bang, jingle bells
And melt bootleg G.I. Joes to black taffy, classic
Fire in the hole backdrafting
Fold wild life out of the wolf pack wrapping
Full moon, bad knee, wool hat, caffeine
TNT plunger in all caps ACME
Blast off half the whole damn mapscreen
No sling no spear
I'm a patchwork of 86'd springs and gears
Who been stung by an un-linked pinky swear
During his what-in-the-fuck-was-I-thinking years
Maybe an awkward phase
Like his acne and sophomore fade
Played, calling all out-of-work action figures
It was death by saturn missiles.
My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz
I was born in 1-9-7-6, at Biosfet hospital, located in Long Island, NY
I am 6 foot, for I weigh 2-0-0 pounds
I have brown hair and green eyes
I enjoy writing songs, painting, movies and diner food
I have two brothers, Chris and Graham
and two parents, Paul and Jameija
In august of 2-0-0-1 I went crazy..
This was originally not for public consumption
This was made for four people... four people that literally saved my life
They know who they are..
And ahhh I mean I could live to be a thousand years old and never re-pay them
I don't think this song would pay for them
But hopefully by putting it out, push the bank a little further..
This ain't a burner for the whips (no it isn't)
This ain't even Aesop Rock fly earthworm demeanor (no it isn't)
My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz and I was born in Long Island, New York
Seventy Six, before Graham and after Chris... OK
In August of 2001 my seemingly splinter-proof brain bone, scaffling imploded
I kept it on the hush, but nearly tumbling
to the cold hard concrete on near bodega trips
for ciggaretes and soda, shook me to kasper
Dizzy with a nothern chaser, motor sensory eraser
Gorophobe tunnel vision, guilt, self loathing arrangements
Rose rapidly outta fog I'd never fished in
that abates three separate foreign men's
While I seems to hook lines and syncro simple fishing
Simple primitive self taught, easing of soul, mind and body
but the symptoms rejected my cave-man modus operandi
So now it's one fish belly up, through medicated mol edge
Shrinks that get 250 an hour for awkward silence
And, I'd be lying if I said all of this
made even the slightest fragment of sense to me
That's frail... Simply put
I don't know what happened, or what's stillhappening
I literally feel like I'm teetering on the blunt edge of my sanity
JAMIE, I killed the robots and I'm sorry
Broke down in front of you, embarrassed
but you lent a heart and hand that only you could
you're one of my best friends and yes I'd take that bullet for you
That's my word, which is about all I have left
TONY, I know you know you crazy, 'cause you told me
but that did never bother you, I hold you as my brother 'til death
And I got your back if ever the drunk goblin step
for makin' a cat laugh, when I was walking with the dead
KATHERINE, mother figure, older sister, concerned be a limits
Letting me know I wasn't the only one with this
Continuous offers for vacation, Chicago visits
Talked me to repair of a head full of broken pistons
RIYAH, for the late night movie rentals and the company I needed
An' you knew it, but I just wouldn't admit it
You listened to me brag about my issues for hours
Offer incredible advice, gave me a hug when I was finished
Am I a jack of all trades? Nope... I like to write songs tho'
Are they good? I dunno..
But I could tell you that I only write shit down when I believe it
So take this how you want, but know I mean it
I want you all to know that I'm scared
Now my fuckin' crooked soul never faced a monster like the last few months
Never in my whole life... I wish I could explain this better (I can't)
But the pieces won't formulate it to anything even close to cohesive
So I guess this is my feeble way to thank you
Four soldiers that extended something sacred off the purity of kindness
I owe you all my life and please don't argue with that statement
'Cause without y'all I may not have a life to offer, take it
Thank you, I wish I could explain this better. (Thank you)
I'm sorry for burdening your pleasures. (Thank you)
I love you all with all that's left of me. (Thank you)
For helping try to kill what made a mess of me. (Thank you)
Somehow, someway. (Thank you)
I'ma get you back someday. (Thank you)
Just gotta figure this all out... So..
I guess it is kind of funny when you look headed from a step back
How one man can literally buckle under the same pressures
Other men operate normally under
I have soaked this out from all angles, walking through time
I have been over everything in my head, still I can't think anymore
But I guess some times, when you can't breathe, there are people there
to breathe for you
I am lucky enough to have those people around me
Thank you for helping me to not die
Thank you for helping me to not die
Pocket full of pennies, and a soul gone tilt
Cockpit full of memories and a dream full of guilt
Serve the vertical thirst, burst horizontal
Treasure, loose cannons span the starbit power
The clippership dipped in truth famine pressure
Cabin fever meter pegging ludicrous
Beautiful cartoon trooper
swallow brutal futility with a teaspoon full of sugar
I rock ready aim fire, while y'all rock ready fire aim
Then blame the stationary target when the prey escapes the frame
Merit badge marksman, a poacher, it's all the same
So I lay across the woods perpendicular to the grain

I gotta be a big bang, gotta be
Never wanna be hear a probably, I wanna see or hear a "Yes sir, sir"
YES SIR!
Armed with a tone, cross, sword to the bone
Warn the other brothers that was born forlorn
Big bang, sharper than a big dick
Hotter than a tunnel of big dreams that think big things
I'ma burn with this little light of mind
and a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang
*repeat except 1st line is "I wanna be a big bang, gotta be"*

I'm just a survivor of the wooly mammoth population
Bottle neck effect, sorta born deaf
Alien of shallow alchemy
If you gon' metamorph the basemetal to precious
Might as well steal from the rich, bewitch the pesants
I'm floating the hoaming pigeon out hell's kitchen window
Left an SOS infested bottle nestled in his grip so
With a prayer circle release party and hardy wild bellow
I observed him fly ten feet then dropped the bottles to the devils
Fertile circle turn pertal crescent via bad investment
Despised every second, but I GUESS I LEARNED MY LESSON!
If I made an angel in the snow for every rotted victim
There'd be wings to float this mothership up out the goblin system
Sticky panoramic contaminate planet
In conjunction with phantom assumption
Gutterbug alumnus candidates
Well, I promise you I man the lighthouse
Just to help guide in your ship
If you promise to help pull this hook out my lip (bitch)
Godspeed, straitjacket and ragged approach
To circle suns via folklore pollutants to rhyme strictly
From a BC generation disgust
Community movement alluding to a
"No blood given, no recognition"
Life matter, I was us up all night with a rusty hammer
Trying to build a fence around these magic beans my dreams are gathered
But uh, that certain lack of avail
I sail a choppy lie with bouancy like a bucket of rocks (a bucket of rocks)


Big bang, bi-big bang
It's gettin bigger by the second
Check it

Ok, I'm here to rock the tugboat and bare the others farewell
I shook the buddy system wisdom till the similairs repel
I sell a barrel of spirit to dummy dimwits syndicate jackals
I'm broken arrow to the fuckin bone (broken poem)
I don't really believe in God
But God, I'm scared to death of God?!?
I swear to God, I never meant to spill the beans
Nor tear the pod
It's like I hike an acre unimpressed
And slept on the sabre's edge
Enough times to splice anti-Christ's favorite pledge
I wanna know myself
Sorta solo sheep amidst wolves
And still my shepherd can't administer the proper push and pulls
I push the ghouls to man overboard
Pull the bulls onto my sword
And buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor
Got an angel on my left shoulder, a devil on the polar
Got a mug a frigid, got a mug a solar, sliiidde over
Therecipe's design unplug the appetite continuity
By stitching together esteemed congruents (beautifully)
I peel back carts and lodge Greek physics in the chambers
Quartarized the wound and heads like "Gimme gimme something major"
Road side prophetic, ascend well
enveloped in a mummy ribbon system
Blistering in a wishing well
BIG BANG!



Bring Back Pluto
And then there were eight (then there were eight).
Just like that.
(Bring back Pluto, bring back, bring back Pluto).
Like: You ain't shit. This ain't ill.
This is little Russian dolls that get smaller and smaller still.
This is a corpus full of pills, trying to sit still and build.
Cause eight planets bullied number nine until he fell.


Who put the monkey wrench in well oiled prefectionist emblem
Just to watch these moniters spit white noise
through your office space auto made
I infect knowledge gene pool dissented cloud clusters
Brushing dust mites off your starborn all revolution sound jugglers
Delinquent fan for brick habitat bob, weave, stick, move fence
and put somewhere in the middle for slick invention
This years brain crop spread spectacular
I ain't mad at cha don't stay mad at the caliber
I twist characters like twist characters
Talley up the alley cat aggresion
in this Doug E. Fresh infested mess up bassline lust
An automatic B-boy krylon can't combust circuits
Working these war picked cyphers
with head striker stability and kamakazi chivalry
I alone noble in a warm food feud
Walking ten generations ain't nobody asking for your patience
Who ranned off but only meet to face the fact
that I knew myself and didn't have to ask nobody else
(Talk about labor) Fantastic planet urchin puting work in
Searching for pertinent verse minus the murderous diversions
Apologies won't lore me to the communal sob story
nor would I sacrifice lifestyle to benefit jewerly temperament
This whole Green Goblin webcutter butts up against
crayola daydream landscapes spittin bedlam, Datum
Charge the villagers nickles and nicotine
to watch them fed to undiscreniled crack at the high noon
(We sell popcorn, beer and balloons!)
I got an echelon this gon be the one children bicker over
And start warriors vs. baseball fury element
to glitches mode of century development
I am a star really! The big bang bastard's back
with a one way ticket to Beat Street
This soil is like relevent to human concept
plot the man ratios man learning, I work past the service
I work on what I love, I work the service on my vertince
And I work till this here little flat line closes the curtains.

I wear shoes to bed
Paint teeth on my lips
Trench foot, gangrened for the win
Blitzkrieg bopper
Petitioned out of shit's creek proper
The only inaccessible blip on the streaming doppler
Screaming ‘uncle’ in a sea of TV doctors
Free to occupy the same space in differing degrees of seedy commerce
The shot is slow pan, monitor guffawing
Flooded p.d. blotter under horizontal coffee
More to follow, outside tweakers are in love
Teeny Raquel Welch submarining through the blood, voyagers
Poisoned or maybejust a misfit toy or two
Depending on the beacon that your voyeurs choose
That sorta hemming and hawing‘ll haunt your boiler rooms abysmally
And kidnap rapid eyes in their infancy
Everything his cutting room scrapped
On a silver screen that throws gummy bears back, attack!

All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to men

Sensible sweater on ice
Devil horns high
Like shovels above a butter lamb with peppercorn eyes
Vendetta-drunk leader squealing
"it's the real pig fever"
Sick people pinky swearing on concealed 6th fingers
That's idle handwork in the spirit of death dealers
Look at mommy's little Hercules
Custom Troy Hurtubise
Flourish in the blind spot of spittle county gore police
Or really any readily ebbing and flowing war and peace
1 plain brown key foods bag head
2 holes later I'll see to this loose flatbread
Cats fucked off, at exactly what cost
The currency of brotherhood back in his cut palm
It sucks, it's nauseating dawn crawling with bugs
They seem attracted to the matters ofthe morally snubbed
See my ‘goodnight irene' massacred flat in the key of tragedy
Whole diner like "i'll have he's having"

All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to men

Today a thousand sea lions got up and left a pier
They had successfully invaded and secured for 20 years
Some said it was the food supply or shifting weather patterns
Truthfully a whole community of scientists are in maybe 10 showed up at the wharf
As if guided by the trident of poseidon to cavort
Each a lumbering and boisterous glutton
Like a half-ton annoyance ‘til the heart-warming story went public
You'll need a montage, animals arriving in droves
A bottom dollar turns a nuisance to the pride of your cove
Which bring us back up to this morning when the colony dove
I got a couple unsubstantiated thoughts of my own they go
Maybe it'd feel more majestic and less fatty
If a 12 year old wasn't beaning it with salt water taffy
Every 5 fucking seconds, sounds like your basic
Liberating moment of collective "fuck fame" shit

All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to men.

These wings...
Have seen things most men would melt apart from
It's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
All my drunk destiny pushed was one radio flyer chock full of halo parts
Ringin' this crime
Like man, I could fix your broken shine
We're all saint swept serpent tide 'round charcoal tomorrow
Bunk holiday debt
easy now brother, I'm here
I'm now, then and there, I we us them it
I'm sorry, I'm God
this final extension's beautiful, but friend, I don't deserve it
I beg of you sweet father
Please detach my chest's swollen lining
I can't handle asymmerty
And if it means my grand finale
Don't tally the votes
Finish me dormant with
Torture machine silencer piece
Position where eyelids will reach
REM well before I’m torn
I've never asked for much
Never felt golden benefit worthy
I gots, what I gots, and what I don't gots don't concern me
I'm no model
Never aspired to be velociraptor fossil
Man, there wasn't rainment
Man, I never had a say in this
I, wanna be the normalcy, that normalcy was jealous of
No shimmer
No celestial flight midwinter
Enter me now
See through Cretin low-life iris
I'm not-I'm not ready for all this business
That for some reason you all refer to as a privilege
I mean, look at me
My feathers drag, this harp plays out of tune
I fly about as straight as a blind tugboat through my legacy
Accidentally killed cupid with his own weaponry
And man, that was my homie
Talk about not cut out for these pristine pearly robings
What could I possibly have done
You really want me to steer child populace back on beaten path
Like teach em' morals
I can't be a part of something I ain't searchin my feelings man
I'm from the dungeon
So from here on out
It's hark the herald nothing
Listen, I quit
That's it
but for the life of me
One thing has plagued my being from the get-go
Why place the most blessed and sacred honors upon an alley cat like this
I just don't get it, oh. my god, it just dawned on me
Wait a second, oh, god...
You have been a witness
You have seen the days when
I apply lies in a billion different ways
and Now I harbor bad karma
Doomed to cope with the fact I dodged the ring but gotta show these cats the ropes
Please lead these little wings to a road
Please lead this little halo to a child with a lighter load
I'mma hold this tight like a life vest and throw it to a mic.
